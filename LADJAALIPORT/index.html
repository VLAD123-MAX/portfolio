            <p class="card__description">
              One of my earliest artworks in Photoshop was inspired by the background theme of the Black Panther movie. This piece was one of my assignments, and I created three samples for it. While this particular artwork looked good to me, I ultimately chose not to present it.

              This artwork, created in Photoshop, was a collaborative effort, although I was the one responsible for its design within our group. I utilized the provided tools to craft it. The inspiration and theme for this project revolved around an esports team.

              This artwork was created during our Palaro event in 2023, where our theme involved taking photos and compiling them to create a unified theme. I devised an idea that centered around our Palaro event, incorporating it into my assignments. Although there were a few mistakes in the process, the overall result would have been better had I not accidentally removed the lower part of the player.

            This rebranding logo was one of our tasks in school, wherein we were tasked with remaking a logo brand and identifying its missing elements to improve upon it. My approach involved scouring Facebook for a logo brand that lacked clarity or coherence to easily identify its deficiencies.

              This design holds a special place among my favorites, crafted during my exploration of Photoshop. Drawing inspiration from Devil Jin from Tekken, I embarked on a search for techniques to render the fiery red hue and attach wings to the character's back. The process was time-consuming, as I was still in the learning and experimentation phase at that time.
